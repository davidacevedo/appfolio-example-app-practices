      This project is an example of the old front-end practices of AppFolio. It
      demonstrates how applications were structured and built using technologies
      like MobX and React Router 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the day, developers focused on creating modular and reusable
      components while managing state effectively. This example showcases those
      principles in action.

      Did you know that AppFolio's engineering team has always been at the
      forefront of adopting new technologies while maintaining a strong
      foundation in best practices?
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of MobX for state management was a popular choice for its
      simplicity and power, allowing developers to create highly interactive
      user interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      React Router 5 was a reliable tool for managing navigation and routing in
      single-page applications, making it easier to build dynamic and responsive
      web apps.
